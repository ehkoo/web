(this presentation will be in English)

This talk, you will learn about:
- How ML/DL are being applied in Computer Vision (a very old field!)
- Comparision between old methods/algorithms of Computer Vision, and the new approaches using Deep Learning
- Discuss how DL in CV are being done in practice (vs theory)

Basic machine learning knowledge are encouraged to get the maximal learning from the talk.

### Agenda:

- Talk: Deep Learning in Computer Vision
- Networking

### Speaker: Dang Huynh, Researcher @ Axon Research

#### About speaker:

Dang Huynh is a researcher in Machine Vision at Axon Research. Prior to joining Axon in 2017, Dang was a researcher in Machine Vision at Misfit where he focused on video-based biometric technology. Before Misfit, he was a research engineer at Nokia Bell Labs, in the Mathematics of Dynamic Systems department from 2011 to 2015. His research interests include machine vision, data science and telecommunication systems. Dang received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC), France.
